# go-profiler-notes

Hey there üëãüèª, I'm [felixge](https://github.com/felixge) and I've just started a new job at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) to work on [Continuous Profiling](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/code-profiling/) for Go.

I found that Go has a lot of profilers and there are many tools for looking at the data, but that there is very little information on what any of it means. So in order to make sure that I know what I'm talking about, I've started to research the existing profilers and how they work. This repository is my attempt to summarize my findings in the hope that it might be useful to others.

- [pprof tool & format](./pprof.md): Describes the pprof tool and the binary data format for storing profiles.
- [Goroutine Profiling](./goroutine.md): Allows you to get a list of all active goroutines and what they're currently doing.
- [Block Profiling](./block.md): Understand how much time your code spends waiting on channels and locks.
- CPU Profiling (üöß coming soon!)
- Heap Profiling (üöß coming soon!)
- Mutex Profiling (üöß coming soon!)
- Wallclock Profiling  (üöß coming soon!)

- Go Docs
  - [Diagnostics](https://golang.org/doc/diagnostics.html): Has a very good overview over the available profiling and tracing facilities but doesn't go into a lot of depth.
  - [runtime/pprof](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/pprof/#Profile): Lists the available profiles and has a little more explanation about what kind of data they produce.
  - [runtime](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/): Has documentation on the various control knobs and pprof facilities, e.g. `MemProfileRate`.
  - [net/http/pprof](https://golang.org/src/net/http/pprof/pprof.go): Not a lot of docs, but diving into the code from there shows how the various profilers can be started/stopped on demand.
