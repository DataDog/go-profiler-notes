# Stack Traces in Go

Stack traces play a critical role in Go profiling. So let's try to understand them to see how they might impact the overhead and accuracy of our profiles. 

## Introduction

All Go profilers work by collecting samples of stack traces and putting them into [pprof profiles](./pprof.md). Ignoring some details, a pprof profile is just a frequency table of stack traces like shown below:

| stack trace  | count |
| ------------ | ----- |
| main;foo     | 5     |
| main;foo;bar | 3     |
| main;foobar  | 4     |

Let's zoom in on the first stack trace in the table above: `main;foo`. A Go developer will usually be more familiar with seeing a stack trace like this as rendered by `panic()` or  [`runtime.Stack()`](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#Stack) as shown below:

```
goroutine 1 [running]:
main.foo(...)
	/path/to/go-profiler-notes/examples/stack-trace/main.go:9
main.main()
	/path/to/go-profiler-notes/examples/stack-trace/main.go:5 +0x3a
```

This text format has been [described elsewhere](https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2015/01/stack-traces-in-go.html) so we won't discuss the details of it here. Instead we'll dive deeper into the source of this data.

## Goroutine Stack

As the name implies, stack traces originate from "the stack". Even so the details vary, most programming languages have a concept of a stack and use it to store things like local variables, arguments, return values and return addresses. Generating a stack trace usually involves navigating the stack in a process known as [Unwinding](#unwinding) that will be described in more detail later on.

Platforms like `x86-64` define a [stack layout](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/09/06/stack-frame-layout-on-x86-64) and [calling convention](https://github.com/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/wiki/x86-64-psABI-1.0.pdf) for C and encourage other programming languages to adopt it for interoperability. Go doesn't follow these conventions, and instead uses its own idiosyncratic [calling convention](https://dr-knz.net/go-calling-convention-x86-64.html). Future versions of Go (1.17?) will adopt a more traditional [register-based](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/changes/78/248178/1/design/40724-register-calling.md) convention that will improve performance . However even the new convention won't be platform-compatible as that would negatively impact goroutine scalability.

Go's stack layout is slightly different on different platforms. To keep things manageable, we'll assume that we're on `x86-64` for the remainder of this note.

### Stack Layout

Now let's take a closer look at the stack. Every goroutine has its own stack that is at least [2 KiB](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:golang/go+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/golang/go%24+_StackMin+%3D&patternType=literal) and grows from a high memory address towards lower memory addresses. This can be a bit confusing and is mostly a historical convention from a time when the address space was so limited that one had to worry about the stack colliding with other memory regions used by the program.

The picture below shows the stack of a sample goroutine that is currently calling `main.foo()` like our example above:

![](./goroutine-stack.png)

There is a lot going on in this picture, but for now let's focus on the things highlighted in red. To get a stack trace, the first thing we need is the current program counter (pc). This is found in a CPU register called `rip` (instruction pointer register) and points to another region of memory that holds the executable machine code of our program. Since we're currently calling `main.foo()`  `rip` is pointing to an instruction within that function. If you're not familiar with registers, you can think of them as special CPU variables that are incredibly fast to access. Some of them, like `rip`, `rsp` or `rbp` have special purposes, while others can be used by compilers as they see fit.

Now that we know the program counter of the current function, it's time to find pc values of our callers, i.e. all the `return address (pc)` values that are also highlighted in red. There are various techniques for doing this, which are described in the [Unwinding](#unwinding) section. The end result is a list of program counters that represent a stack trace just like the one you can get from [`runtime.Callers()`](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#Callers). Last but not least, these `pc` values are usually translated into human readable file/line/function names as described in the [Symbolization](#symbolization) section below. In Go itself you can simply calll [`runtime.CallerFramers()`](https://golang.org/pkg/runtime/#CallersFrames) to symbolize a list of `pc` values.

### Real Example

Looking at pretty pictures can be a good way to get a high level understanding of the stack, but it has its limits. Sometimes you need to look at the raw bits & bytes in order to get a full understanding. If you're not interested in that, feel free to skip ahead to the next section.

To take a look at the stack, we'll use [delve](https://github.com/go-delve/delve) which is a wonderful debugger for Go. In order to inspect the stack, I wrote a script called [stackannotate.star](./delve/stackannotate.star) that can used to print the annotated stack for a simple [example program](./examples/stackannotate/main.go):

```
$ dlv debug ./examples/stackannotate/main.go 
Type 'help' for list of commands.
(dlv) source delve/stackannotate.star
(dlv) continue examples/stackannotate/main.go:19

    20:		}
    21:		return s
    22:	}

```

The script isn't perfect and there are some addresses on the stack that it's unable to automatically annotate for now (contributions welcome!). But generally speaking, you should be able to use it to check your understanding against the abstract stack drawing that was presented earlier.

If you want to try it out yourself, perhaps modify the example program to spawn `main.foo()` as a goroutine and observe how that impacts the stack.

## Unwinding

Unwinding (or stack walking) is the process of collecting all the return addresses (see red elements in [Stack Layout](#stack-layout)) from the stack. Together with the current instruction pointer register (`rip`) they form a list of program counter (`pc`) values that can be turned into a human readable stack trace via [Symbolization](#symbolization).

The Go runtime, including the builtin profilers, exclusively use  [.gopclntab](#gopclntab) for unwinding. However, we'll start with describing [Frame Pointer](#frame-pointer) unwinding first, because it is much easier to understand and might [become supported in the future](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16638).

### Frame Pointer

Frame pointer unwinding is the simple process of following the base pointer register (`rbp`) to the first frame pointer on the stack which points to the next frame pointer and so on. In other words, it is following the orange lines in the [Stack Layout](#stack-layout) graphic. For each visited frame pointer, the return address (pc) sitting 8 bytes above the frame pointer is collected along the way. That's it : ).

The main downside to frame pointers is that pushing them onto the stack adds some performance overhead to every function call during normal program execution. The Go authors estimated an average 2% execution overhead for an average program in the [Go 1.7 release notes](https://golang.org/doc/go1.7). Because of this compilers such as `gcc` offer options such as `-fomit-frame-pointers` to omit them for better performance. However, it's a devil's bargain: It gives you small performance win right away, but it reduces your ability to debug and diagnose performance issues in the future. Because of this the general advice is:

> Always compile with frame pointers. Omitting frame pointers is an evil compiler optimization that breaks debuggers, and sadly, is often the default.
> â€“ [Brendan Gregg](http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html)

In Go you don't even need this advice. Since Go 1.7 frame pointers are enabled by default for 64 bit binaries, and there is no `-fomit-frame-pointers` footgun available. This allows Go to be compatible with third party debuggers and profilers such as [Linux perf](http://www.brendangregg.com/perf.html) out of the box.

If you'd like to see frame pointer unwinding in action, you can check out [this tiny code snippet](https://github.com/felixge/gounwind/blob/5cc8505361807a22169595999689bd793ed6d391/gounwind.go) which is a fast alternative to the official `runtime.Callers()` implementation. The simplicity should speak for itself when compared to the other unwinding methods described below. It should also be clear that frame pointer unwinding has `O(N)` time complexity where `N` is the number of stack frames that need to be traversed.

Despite the apparent simplicity, frame pointer unwinding is no panacea. Frame pointers are pushed to the stack by the callee, so for interrupt based profiling there is a race condition that might cause you to miss the caller of the current function in your stack trace. Additionally frame pointer unwinding can't unwind inlined function calls. So at least some of the complexity of [.gopclntab](#gopclntab) or [DWARF](#dwarf) is essential to enable accurate unwinding.

### .gopclntab

Despite frame pointers being available on 64bit platforms, Go is not leveraging them for unwinding ([this might change](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16638)). Instead Go ships with its own idiosyncratic unwinding tables that are embedded in the `.gopclntab` section of any Go binary. `.gopclntab` stands for "go program counter line table", but this is a bit of a misnomer as it contains various tables and meta data required for unwinding and symbolization. For unwinding, the general idea is to embed a table that maps every program counter (`pc`) to the current distance (delta) of the stack pointer (`rsp`) from the nearest `return address (pc)` above it. The initial lookup uses the `pc` from the `rip` instruction pointer register and then uses the `return address (pc)` for the next lookup and so on.

Russ Cox initially described some of the involved data structures in his [Go 1.2 Runtime Symbol Information](https://golang.org/s/go12symtab) document, but it's very outdated by now and it's probably better to look at the current implementation directly. The relevant files are [runtime/traceback.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.16.3/src/runtime/traceback.go) and [runtime/symtab.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.16.3/src/runtime/symtab.go), so let's dive in.

There are various use cases for stack traces in Go, but they all end up hitting the [`gentraceback()`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.16.3/src/runtime/traceback.go#L76-L86) function. If the caller is e.g. `runtime.Callers()` the function only needs to do unwinding, but e.g. `panic()` wants text output, which requires symbolization as well. Additionally the code has to deal with the difference between [link register architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_register) such as ARM that work a little different from x86. This combination of unwinding, symbolization, support for different architectures and bespoke data structures might just be a regular day in the shop for the system developers on the Go team, but it's definitely been tricky for me, so please watch out for potential inaccuracies in my description below.

Each frame lookup begins with the current `pc` which is passed to [`findfunc()`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.16.3/src/runtime/symtab.go#L671) which looks up the meta data for the function that contains the `pc`. Historically this was done using `O(log N)` binary search, but [nowadays](https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/2097/) there is a hash-map-like index of [`findfuncbucket`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.16.3/src/runtime/symtab.go#L671) structs that usually directly guides us to the right entry using an `O(1)` algorithm. So at this point the overall complexity is still the same as frame pointer unwinding, but it's worth noting that the constant overheads are already significantly higher.

The [_func](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/9baddd3f21230c55f0ad2a10f5f20579dcf0a0bb/src/runtime/runtime2.go#L825) meta data that we just retrieved contains a `pcsp` offset into the `pctab` table that maps program counters to stack pointer deltas. To decode this information, we call [`funcspdelta()`](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/go1.16.3/src/runtime/symtab.go#L903) which does a `O(N)` linear search over all program counters of the function until it finds the (`pc`, `sp delta`) pair were are looking for. For stacks with recursive call cycles, a tiny program counter cache is used to avoids doing lots of duplicated work.

Now that that we have the stack pointer delta, we we are almost ready to locate the next `return address (pc)` value of the caller and do the same lookup for it until we reach the "bottom" of the stack. However, we before that we need to check if the current `pc` is part of one or more inlined function calls. This is done by checking the `_FUNCDATA_InlTree` data for the current `_func` and doing another linear search over the (`pc`, `inline index`) pairs that exist. Any inlined call found this way gets virtual stack frame `pc` added to the list. Then we continue with `return address (pc)` as mentioned in the beginning of the paragraph.

Putting it all together, for non-recursive call stacks without inlining, the complexity for `gopclntab` unwinding is `O(N*M)` where `N` is the number of frames on the stack, and `M` is the average size of the generated machine code per function. This can be validated [experimentally](https://github.com/DataDog/go-profiler-notes/tree/main/examples/stack-unwind-overhead), but in the real world I'd expect the average `N` and `M` to be fairly similar for most non-trivial Go applications, so unwinding a stack (without symbolization) will generally cost `1-10Âµs`. That being said, naive frame pointer unwinding appears to be [50x faster](https://github.com/felixge/gounwind), and does less cache thrashing, so high-resolution profiling and tracing use cases would likely benefit from seeing [support for it in the core](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16638).

Last but not least, it's worth noting that Go ships with two `.gopclntab` implementations. In addition to the one I've just described, there is also the [debug/gosym](https://golang.org/pkg/debug/gosym/) package that implements some of the same code as `runtime/symtab.go` and seems to be used by the linker, `go tool addr2line` and others. If you want, you can use it yourself in combination with [debug/elf](./examples/pclnttab/linux.go) or ([debug/macho](./examples/pclnttab/darwin.go)) to go on your [gopclntab adventures](./examples/pclnttab).
