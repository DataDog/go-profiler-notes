go-profiler-notes
=================

This project was started by `Felix Geisend√∂rfer <https://felixge.de/>`_ after joining Datadog's `Continuous Profiler <https://docs.datadoghq.com/profiler/>`_ team in early 2021. Initially it was just a loose collection of markdown files with notes on Go profiling. But over time and thanks to a few `contributors <https://github.com/DataDog/go-profiler-notes/graphs/contributors>`_, it has developed into one of the most in-depth resources on Go profiling.

In the future, additional topics such as runtime tracing, metrics, heap debugging as well as userland metrics and distributed tracing will be covered as well.
