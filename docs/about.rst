About This Guide
=====

Formerly known as "go-profiler-notes", this project was initiated by `Felix Geisendörfer`_ upon joining the profiling team at Datadog in 2021. At the time, Go provided a significant number of profiling features, but there was a lack of resources on how to effectively utilize and interpret the generated data. The project initially began as a collection of markdown notes, but it eventually evolved into a comprehensive resource for Go profiling and beyond.
